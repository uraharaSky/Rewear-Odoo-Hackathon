## 📝 Problem Statement  
ReWear is a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing through **direct swaps** or a **point-based redemption system**.

Our mission is to promote **sustainable fashion** and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to give their wearable garments a second life — instead of discarding them.
